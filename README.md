# Final Year Project on Interactive Network Visualisation

This repository contains the code for my final year project on Interactive Network Visualisation. The produced program can be found in the /dist/ folder and does not require any installation to run. Place the index.html and main.js files in the same folder, and open index.html

# Installing dev tools
To modify the project, one must install npm and run

`npm install`

to download required dependencies.
